## Important Notes
* This is an evolving list

# What is this:
* This is a collection of potentially malicious scripts

# copy-specific-files.py
* This script takes a directory and looks at it, and all of its subdirectories to find file names that contain special terms. The special terms are defined in a list. If it happens to find a file that matches the special terms it then copies the file to the destination you specify.
