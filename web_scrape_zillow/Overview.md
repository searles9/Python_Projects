## Important Notes
* I used this YouTube video as a guide and then made minor adjustements to the code: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dRcvJRmqFHQ

# What is this:
This is a Python script that can be used to web scrape ```Zillow.com```. 

You can run this script directly to have the results outputted to a CSV file or you can import this file in another script to use the web scraping functions.

# How to use this:
```
python web_scrape_zillow.py
```
For each page that the script grabs data from you should see a ```200``` outputted in the console.
```
$ python web_scrape_zillow.py
200
200
200
200
200
200

```
